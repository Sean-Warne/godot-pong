# Pong Clone in Godot

This is a simple clone of pong built in Godot.

Pixel art is from [Godot.org](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/2.1/learning/step_by_step/simple_2d_game.html#assets) and the font is from [fontspace (public domain)](https://www.fontspace.com/public-pixel-font-f72305).

This project taught me the very, very basics of 2D game development in an engine including 2D movement with vectors, basic AI, and scoring.
